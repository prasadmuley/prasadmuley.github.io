## First Post

I was searching on internet for **What to write in first blog post** But I thought **Hello World!** deserves it.
Most of the time we print these two words to learn new programming language.


#### Why "Hello World" deserves first post??
Most of you may have above question in your mind.
I am using [**jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com) which is static site generator But **jekyll** is completely new to me.
I searched some themes and liked [**minimal-mistakes**](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) theme.
As I am not familiar with **jekyll** and **minimal-mistakes** theme.
So *I've decided to test it using **Hello World!***


>**"Blooging is not rocket science, it's about being yourself and putting what you have into it."**

I read this quote somewhere. Being Software Developer, I'll write some **technical** posts here.
I'll also try to write **non-technical** posts. Let's see what I **write**. I'll enjoy a lot by writting posts. I hope you'll too.

#### Feel free to connect me.

I love python programming, photography, painting/sketching, Bike riding and Trekking.
I am available on github, twitter, instagram and quora.
