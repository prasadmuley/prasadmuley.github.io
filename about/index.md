* Currently, I am working as a Software Developer at [OneDelta](onedelta.in). Exploring [Web2Py](http://web2py.com/) and [PyDAL](https://github.com/web2py/pydal) for software product development.

* I've completed my bachelors in Information Technology from [Pune Institute of Computer Technology, Pune](pict.edu), Batch of 2013.

* Apart from programming, I have interest in photography, painting, sketching and bike riding. I spend my leisure time on github, quora and instagram.
